# ABCDQC Web Server

## Introduction
This is one of the projects from the NCBI collaborative biodata science hackathon 
[http://biohackathons.github.io](http://biohackathons.github.io). Our group is working on a project to automatically QC the [ABCD study data](https://data-archive.nimh.nih.gov/abcd). [Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SSinOI-IDNTdZreTARghN799z-Oi2Bn-H6-xFGCnIVc/edit?usp=sharing) is a copy of our initial presentation. 

This project is composed of three github repos ([abcdqc_webserver](https://github.com/abcdqc/abcdqc_webserver), [abcdqc_batchserver](https://github.com/abcdqc/abcdqc_batchserver), [abcdqc_hcp_notebooks](https://github.com/abcdqc/abcdqc_hpc_notebooks)) that work on two AWS instances and utilize the NIH high performance computing cluster.

This repo contain the code running the NGINX webserver on the AWS client that serves the interactive visualizations from http://abcdqc.org

## Background
The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study will track approximately 10,000 nine- and ten-year-old children longitudinally throughout adolescence and early adulthood. Approximately half the enrolled participants were identified as likelier to engage in high risk behaviors and/or develop mental health problems during adolescence. It is the largest neuroimaging study of this type, and aims to track the arc of mental health development within a nationally-representative sample. Data are generated by 21 imaging centers throughout the United States, with imaging acquisitions and parameters optimized for better compatibility across 3T scanners. Imaging data include T1-, T2- and diffusion-weighted structural scans and functional MRI. Both resting state and task-based fMRI scans are collected (Casey et al., 2018).

## Purpose
Coming soon

## Workflow

## Installation 
Coming soon

To run the nginx web server, put the build files in /some/directory/ and the data files in /some/directory/data/ then run

     docker run --name nginx-data -d -p 80:80 -v /some/directory:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro nginx

## How to Use
Coming soon

Example JSON structure:
    {
        efc: { // IQMs at the top level
            mean: .55; // general stats
            quartiles: [.5, .6],
            kde: [ // then an array of the KDE curve values
                [10, .5], // first element is the density (width of the violin), second variable is the metric value
                [20, .6]
            ]
        }
    }
